# Sinatra Bingo

## What it is

This is a frontend application built to interact with a backend that was the true focus of this project. As such, the styling is pretty much as bare-bones as I could make it while still looking decent. Also, I had the backend handle some of what may normally have been handled by the frontend to hone my backend developing skills. Just something to keep in mind if you're sifting through the code in this repository. The code for the backend is [here](https://github.com/nkulik94/phase-3-sinatra-react-project).

The app was made with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and styled with a mixture of [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) and plain old CSS.

## How to run it

The app is not deployed at the moment, to run it clone the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start`. For it to work, it'll need the backend running too, see the [README](https://github.com/nkulik94/phase-3-sinatra-react-project#readme) in the backend repo for instructions on how to do that.

## What it does

This is a bingo game! Users can play bingo and track their scores, as well as see the high scores for each of the boards in the database. See the backend repo for information about the database we're working with as well as the routes that have been set up.

See you in the backend,
